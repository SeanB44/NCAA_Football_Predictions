### TO do for full model
# fix differences in team names between CFB Reference ad cfbd
# spread game into one row
# Add Advanced Stats (Add to this model too)
# Add returning prduction (add to this model too)
# incorporate schedule to pull in home team and away team, ideally this will have results and a game ID also
